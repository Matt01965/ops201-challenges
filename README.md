# Ops201-Challenges

Welcome! 

This repo is a collection of coding assignments centered around learning the fundamentals of Python, Bash and PowerShell. Assingments are from three Code Fellows courses; Ops 201: Foundations of Computer Operations, Ops 301: Networking and System Administration, and Ops 401: Cybersecurity Engineering.

I am learning these skills to increase my overall efficiency when completing cybersecurity tasks in the terminal. Through these exercises I learned how to use functions, variables, loops, arguments, and conditionals. Ultimately, I was able to automate some security related processes such as back-ups, encryption, and port scanning.

# Ops 201 
My favorite Ops 201 Challenge was from [Lesson 13](https://github.com/Matt01965/ops201-challenges/blob/main/domainanalyzer.sh). It is a simple bash script using <nslookup>. However, it was the first bash script I wrote that came 'naturally', without having to work out multiple errors or reference a syntax guide every line. 

Shell scripting can help immensely to automate routine cybersecurity functions and search large datasets.
